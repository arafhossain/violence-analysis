# Innocent Lives Matter Project

## Background
* What percentage of terrorists who claim Islam are from a middle class background?
* How many children have been killed by drone strikes?
* Do Muslim terrorists kill more Muslims or non Muslims?

These are questions that can lead to emotional opinions, and these emotional opinions have dominated the global conversation on one of the world's most complicated cultural rifts.

In terms of colloquial language and news media, a basic refrain that's heard is "we have to attack them because they are attacking us".

Well, we plan to get more clarity on this topic, through good ol' data science and user experience design.

This is an attempt to make the world's most comprehensive data initiative to understand violence that targets innocent people.

Hopefully this will give reporters and those who are interested a tool to understand the complexities our current global tensions.
